Hadoop Ecosystem

Apache Hive
Datawarehouse tool built on top of Hadoop
Mainly used for providing data query and analysis
Provides SQL-type language for querying called HQL

Apache Sqoop
Sqoop is a special MapReduce job where only mappers work
Used for transferring the data between relational database and Hadoop

Apache Spark
In Spark, only a one-time read(disk read) is required at the initial stage for reading the data from HDFS and all the processing is done.
In memory finally, the final write is required to be done to HDFS. 
So, overall 2 times disk I/O access is required.All other inbetween tasks takes place in memory.
And this is the reason Spark is 10-100 times faster than MapReduce

Databases
MySQL
Relational Database management system 
The language used for accessing and managing the records in the database

Approach
Create an AWS EC2 instance and launch it
Create docker images using the docker-compose file on the EC2 machine
Create the tables in MySQL relational database management system
Load the data from MySQL into HDFS storage using Sqoop commands.
Move the data from HDFS to Hive
Extract customer information from data using Scala code and store it as a parquet file
Move the parquet file from Spark to Hive
Create tables in Hive and load the data from parquet files into tables
Perform Hive analytics on sales and Customer data

RDBMS
Read and write multiple times
Can update if needed
coming under Transactional system
considered as monolithic system

HIVE
write once,read multiple times
not for quick updates
usually for analytical systems
get advantage of distributed or parallel computing


Hive table - two parts(components)
1) where actual data is stored-->hdfs(this data we cant alter)
2)metadata --> schema of data (storing in anydatabase, eg derby)

Hive table- types of table
1)Internal table
2)external table

external - even after dropping table,data in hdfs is saved
internal - data permanently deleted along with meta data when we delete

Hive doesnt have authority to completely get rid of data
